# eCommerce-Transaction-Analysis
This GitHub repository hosts a detailed implementation of a comprehensive data analysis project that encompasses three critical components: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Modeling, and Customer Segmentation. Each component is designed to provide insights into customer behavior and enhance business strategies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA serves as the foundational step in understanding the dataset. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The techniques employed include:
Univariate Analysis: Examining single variables to understand their distribution and characteristics through methods like histograms and box plots.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigating the relationships between two variables using scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
Multivariate Analysis: Exploring interactions among multiple variables, often utilizing techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce complexity.
The EDA process helps identify data quality issues, detect outliers, and formulate hypotheses for further analysis. Insights derived from EDA guide subsequent modeling efforts, ensuring that the chosen methods are appropriate for the data's inherent characteristics.
Lookalike Modeling
The Lookalike Model aims to identify customers who share similar profiles and transaction histories. This model leverages customer and product information to recommend three similar customers based on a user's input. The process includes:
Data Integration: Combining customer demographics with transaction data to create a comprehensive profile.
Similarity Scoring: Employing algorithms to calculate similarity scores between customers, facilitating targeted marketing strategies.
The output of this task is a "Lookalike.csv" file that maps Customer IDs to their top three lookalikes, along with their respective similarity scores. This information is invaluable for personalized marketing campaigns and enhancing customer engagement.
Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Customer segmentation involves categorizing customers based on their profiles and transaction behaviors using clustering techniques. The project allows flexibility in selecting clustering algorithms and determining the number of clusters (between 2 and 10). Key components include:
Clustering Algorithms: Implementing methods such as K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers with similar characteristics.
Clustering Metrics: Evaluating the effectiveness of the clustering using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index), which measures cluster separation.
Visualization tools are employed to illustrate the clusters formed, providing insights into customer segments that can inform strategic decisions in marketing and product offerings.
